<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Leonardo Rosa ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="left">
    Iâ€™m a recent graduate in Electrical Engineering from UEL - State University of Londrina, focused on Embedded Systems and engaged in rocketry.<br><br>
    Here youâ€™ll mainly find some projects I created to learn programming, others just to satisfy my curiosity about random wonderings.<br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy exploring astronomy, music, visual arts, and design.
